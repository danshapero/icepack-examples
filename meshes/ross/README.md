This directory contains scripts for fetching and unpacking a mesh of the Ross ice shelf used for demos during the 2009 Portland, OR Summer Modeling School.
The mesh is originally hosted at:

[http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/Ice_shelves](http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/Ice_shelves)

Near as I can tell, the mesh was made in COMSOL by Todd Dupont and Olga Sergienko.
