# icepack-examples

This directory contains the example code for icepack.
The core icepack library and the icepack python library must be installed on your path somewhere.
Some examples use purely synthetic data; others use real data sets, which can be fetched and processed using the scripts in `../data/`.
Each example contains a more detailed readme describing which features of icepack it demonstrates, along with HTML documentation providing a nice side-by-side view of the source code and annotated comments.
