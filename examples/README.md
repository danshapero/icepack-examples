# icepack-examples

This directory contains the example code for icepack.
The core icepack library and the icepack python library must be installed on your path somewhere.
Some examples use purely synthetic data; others use real data sets, which can be fetched and processed using the scripts in `../data/`.

If any of documentation doesn't make sense or explain the code enough, please raise an issue on the icepack-examples github repository.
These examples are to show you how to use icepack, so if they don't make sense then I haven't done my job!
