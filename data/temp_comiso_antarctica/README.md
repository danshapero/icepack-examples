This data set was collated from several sources to support development on the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM), and actually contains several other data sets in the same netCDF file.
The temperature data came from J Comiso, 2000, "Variability and trends in Antarctica surface temperatures from in situ and satellite infrared measurements", J. Climate.
