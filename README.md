# icepack-examples

This repository contains example code for the glacier modelling library [icepack](https://github.com/danshapero/icepack).
You will need a working installation of icepack somewhere on your path.

The directory `examples` contains the actual example programs, while the directory `data` contains scripts for fetching and processing glacier data from various sources on the internet, for example the [National Snow and Ice Data Center](https://www.nsidc.org).
Some of the example programs use real data, and these will need to be fetched and processed first.
See the README in each of these directories for more specifics.
